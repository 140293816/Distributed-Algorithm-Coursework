My project does not contain extra configuration, just import it into eclipse. 

It mainly contains four classes:

AbstractNode: superclass of the following 2 types of nodes;
NodeOfElection: this class is built for nodes in Election Algorithm which contains diffusion part;
NodeOfTree: this class is built for nodes in Tree Wave Algorithm without diffusion part;
TreeModel: this class provides methods to create different types of trees and test the algorithms.

You could also test its function in TreeTest.java.
